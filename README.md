The file outputstream.txt contains a string as output (fig 1) from a service. Parse it in to JSON that matches the structure given in sample.json
Notes: 
    • the id property in the sample JSON is an md5 hash of the label and the Web Address property
    • if the item is marked as not found, discard it, and do not include it in the output
